## Intro

Flat is boring, eveyone knows.

It's why Earth was made a ball (of course, not initially), and why Einstein invented curved spacetime. 

## Libraries

We use D3.js. It sounds close to 3D, so we should be fine, right?

## License 

The content (except for D3.js) is distributed on [WTFLP](http://www.wtfpl.net/), the only license serious enough for this project.
