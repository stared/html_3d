Web is a great medium to express thoughts, feeling and impressions. But, as you surely have noticed, it often lacks... depth.<br><br>

And to be honest, flat things are not cool. Greeks made earth a sphere (later deformed by more accurate meaurements). Geeks made 3d games. Einstein made spacetime curved. Adolescence made... never mind.<br><br>

So, please keep your eyes crossed and proceed to experience web in 3D.<br><br>

It should work without any special equipment, and even without Facebook account (thanks to hardware in your brian; if it does not work for you, check if your both eyes are plugged in; if it is a firmware issue, I can recommend you some neurobiologists who were kicked out from their field due to ethical concerns, so they need to work on side by updating firmware in brains.)<br><br>

It's cool, isn't it?<br><br><br>

Also, it works great for data:
